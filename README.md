Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a significant step that investigates the dataset in search of specific patterns and anomalies. The main goal of the project is to analyse the data and helps business to allocate their resources in the correct place.

**Problem Statement**:

The hotel industry is one of the volatile businesses that depends on various factors like seasons, festivals, weekend days, and many more.
The analysis of the dataset helps these businesses to prepare for future circumstances like a boom in bookings and various uneven customer demands. Hotel booking data includes a set of information regarding bookings of a customer that includes the number of adults, arrival date & year, country, etc.

**Fields**:

There are various fields available that help in going through the analysis. 
The booking option for the hotels is two i.e., city hotels and resort hotels. There is no personal information of customers used in the data. 

**Import Libraries**:

For analysis, we have used NumPy for mathematical calculation.The data visualization has been done through the pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

**Data Profiling**:

Data profiling is the method of analysing and assessing the data to discover some patterns. It helps in searching data quality issues and general trends.
Some initial steps of data profiling are:

1.	Import data in google colab or Jupiter notebook
2.	See the columns field
3.	Analyse initial rows
4.	Check the overall information of each column and rows

**Data Cleaning**:

Cleaning of data is necessary when it contains a large number of null values or duplicate entries.
Data cleaning is done to get better data quality and increase credibility.

Some basic steps in data cleaning:
1.	Check null values
2.	Replace null values with other reliable entries
3.	Drop duplicate rows
4.	If needed, drop unnecessary columns
5.	If needed, remove unnecessary outliers
 
**Data Visualization**:
 
As we all know, data are raw facts and figures. These raw facts and figures can be graphically represented to make them more understandable.
Data visualization can be done through charts, graphs, and maps. It helps in understanding trends, patterns, and outliers. 
The simple presentation of data through graphs helps the non-technical audience to understand easily. It is one of the most interactive methods to learn and has the ability to uncover the hidden story of data.
